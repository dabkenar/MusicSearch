Feature 1
I added an "All" button to go along with the genre filters. Pressing this button will clear all genre filters and show the original search results. It is not interactive
like the other genre buttons but only acts as a "reset." Pressing it when no genres are selected will have no functionality

Feature 2
I changed the website behavior when no search results come up because I think it feels more similar to other UIs I have used and makes for a better experience.
The same Alert box will show up, but I made it so that the previous search results still show on the page. I also remove the invalid search query from the text box
when the alert box comes up.
